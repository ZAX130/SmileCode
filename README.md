### Environment
Code has been tested with Python 3.9 and PyTorch 1.11.
### Dataset
LPBA [[link]](https://resource.loni.usc.edu/resources/atlases-downloads/)
Mindboggle [[link]](https://osf.io/yhkde/)

### Instruction
For convenience, we are sharing the preprocessed [LPBA](https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1mFzZDn2qPAiP1ByGZ7EbsvEmm6vrS5WO&export=download&authuser=0) dataset used in our experiments. Once uncompressed, simply modify the "LPBA_path" in `train.py` to the path name of the extracted data. Next, you can execute `train.py` to train the network, and after training, you can run `infer.py` to test the network performance.

(Update) We encourage you to try the ModeTv2 code, as it enhances registration accuracy while significantly reducing both runtime and memory usage.

The overall framework and some network components of the code are heavily based on [TransMorph](https://github.com/junyuchen245/TransMorph_Transformer_for_Medical_Image_Registration) and [VoxelMorph](https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph). We are very grateful for their contributions. The file makePklDataset.py shows how to make a pkl dataset from the original LPBA dataset. If you have any other questions about the .pkl format, please refer to the github page of [[TransMorph_on_IXI]](https://github.com/junyuchen245/TransMorph_Transformer_for_Medical_Image_Registration/blob/main/IXI/TransMorph_on_IXI.md).
