The overall framework and some network components of the code are heavily based on [TransMorph](https://github.com/junyuchen245/TransMorph_Transformer_for_Medical_Image_Registration) and [VoxelMorph](https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph). We are very grateful for their contributions. If you have any questions about the .pkl format, please refer to the github page of TransMorph.
